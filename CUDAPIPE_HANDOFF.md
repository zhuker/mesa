# cudapipe — CUDA Software Rasterizer for Roblox

## What This Is

A Mesa Vulkan ICD (`libvulkan_cudapipe.so`) that rasterizes on NVIDIA GPUs using
CUDA compute kernels instead of fixed-function hardware. It reuses lavapipe as
the Vulkan frontend and replaces the Gallium driver underneath.

The feature set is driven by what Roblox's HeadlessStreamer actually requires,
measured from a GFXReconstruct capture — see
`src/gallium/drivers/cudapipe/tests/headless_streamer_requirements.txt`.

## Build

```bash
meson setup build-cudapipe -Dvulkan-drivers=swrast \
  -Dgallium-drivers=llvmpipe,cudapipe -Dllvm=enabled -Dglx=disabled \
  -Degl=disabled -Dplatforms= -Dgbm=disabled -Dgles1=disabled -Dgles2=disabled \
  -Dopengl=false -Dglvnd=disabled
ninja -C build-cudapipe
```

meson and ninja come from a pip venv at `./venv` (the distro's meson is too
old); it also needs `mako`, `packaging` and `pyyaml`. If the venv is missing,
`ninja` fails before compiling anything, because `build.ninja` records the
absolute path of the meson that generated it — recover with
`./venv/bin/meson setup --reconfigure build-cudapipe`.

CUDA is 12.8 at `/usr/local/cuda`, so `cuCtxCreate` takes three arguments;
code written against CUDA 13's four-argument form does not compile. The Vulkan
SDK is at `~/vulkan-sdk/1.4.357.1/x86_64` — put its `bin` on `PATH`.

```bash
export PATH="$PWD/venv/bin:$HOME/vulkan-sdk/1.4.357.1/x86_64/bin:$PATH"
ninja -C build-cudapipe src/gallium/targets/cudapipe/libvulkan_cudapipe.so
```

Run without installing:

```bash
VK_DRIVER_FILES=$PWD/build-cudapipe/src/gallium/targets/cudapipe/cudapipe_devenv_icd.x86_64.json \
  <vulkan app>
```

## Testing: the sample sweep

The Sascha Willems samples at `~/git/Vulkan` all render offscreen and
reproducibly, which makes them a differential oracle: run the same binary
against the NVIDIA ICD and against cudapipe, and diff the frames. That is a far
stronger signal than dEQP's pass/fail, and it found every bug fixed so far.

`tests/headless_streamer_samples.txt` is the minimal set — each entry is the
simplest sample covering a capability the capture needs, with the mapping in the
file.

```bash
cd ~/git/Vulkan
S="$(grep -v '^#' ~/mesa/src/gallium/drivers/cudapipe/tests/headless_streamer_samples.txt | tr '\n' ' ')"
ICD=~/mesa/build-cudapipe/src/gallium/targets/cudapipe/cudapipe_devenv_icd.x86_64.json

SAMPLES="$S" VALIDATION=0 OUT=build/compare/ref \
  VK_DRIVER_FILES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json ./run_offscreen.sh
SAMPLES="$S" VALIDATION=0 OUT=build/compare/cuda \
  VK_DRIVER_FILES=$ICD ./run_offscreen.sh

cd build/compare
python3 ~/mesa/src/gallium/drivers/cudapipe/tests/cp_gallery.py ref cuda \
    -o cudapipe_vs_nvidia.html
```

`cp_compare.py` diffs two images (PNG, or the PPM the samples write) and prints a
percentage plus an ASCII map. `cp_gallery.py` builds an HTML page: summary table
sorted worst-first, then reference / result / difference per sample, every panel
full resolution and clickable, the result hover-flipping to the reference.

**Editing a sample's shader is the fastest way to bisect a difference.** The
samples load `.spv` at runtime, so `glslangValidator -V shader.vert -o
shader.vert.spv` and re-running both drivers takes seconds and needs no C++
rebuild. Two bugs below were found that way after static reasoning got them
wrong; back the `.spv` up first and restore it afterwards.

## Status

Differing pixels versus the NVIDIA driver at tolerance 8/255, worst first.
Total across the set: 110,015, from 143,856 before the quad-derivative work and
far more before that.

| Sample | Differing | Note |
|---|---|---|
| texturemipmapgen | 3.50% | anisotropic filter fidelity |
| multisampling | 2.58% | no MSAA |
| particlesystem | 2.51% | no POINT_LIST rasterization |
| gltfscenerendering | 1.70% | no diagnosis |
| texturecubemap | 0.53% | |
| instancing | 0.38% | mostly the procedural starfield, see below |
| computeshader | 0.31% | |
| multithreading | 0.22% | speckle, no diagnosis |
| pbribl | 0.14% | |
| texture | 591 px | anisotropic taps on a slightly tilted quad |
| vulkanscene | 27 px | |
| dynamicuniformbuffer | 15 px | |
| bloom | 10 px | |
| texture3d | 4 px | |
| renderheadless | 0 | the host readback path |
| negativeviewportheight | 0 | |
| pushconstants | 0 | |
| triangle | 0 | |

Fourteen of eighteen are within a handful of pixels, from one before this work.
Of the four that are not, two are unimplemented features rather than defects.

```

Shaders run as CUDA kernels named `main` taking one argument, a pointer to an
array of pointers:

| Slot | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | thread/vertex/pixel count |
| 2 | input buffer (vertex attributes, or interpolated varyings) |
| 3 | input stride |
| 4 | output buffer |
| 5 | vertex-id array |
| 6 | fragment coordinates |
| 7 | draw parameters |
| 8 | discard mask (fragment stage) |
| 18.. | uniform/descriptor buffers |

**Fragments are shaded four to a 2x2 quad**, so the sampler can take
screen-space derivatives by shuffling between lanes rather than reading a stored
per-varying derivative. That is what lets a coordinate the shader computed for
itself — a reflection vector — pick a mip level at all. A quad belongs to one
triangle: `cp_fs_interpolate` emits a separate quad per distinct triangle in a
2x2 block, because differencing across two triangles produces a meaningless
derivative at every seam. Corners no triangle covers are still shaded as helper
lanes and dropped by the writeback.

## Known gaps, roughly by how much they matter

1. **No MSAA.** The capture needs 4x on D32_SFLOAT, A2B10G10R10 and R8_UNORM.
2. **No line or point rasterization.** The capture uses POINT_LIST.
3. **Anisotropic filtering does not match NVIDIA's**, which is most of what is
   left in `texturemipmapgen`. The implementation follows llvmpipe; the residual
   peaks at mid distance where the filter does the most work.
4. **Alpha-tested geometry costs CP_DISCARD_LAYERS passes over the draw.**
   Visibility resolves before shading, so a fragment that discards has already
   displaced the one behind it; each pass records what discarded where and
   repeats so the next fragment can win. Sponza's foliage falls from 543
   discards to 1 within four passes; halving the layers from 8 to 4 costs it
   0.14% of the frame, and anything still discarding after the last layer is
   lost.
5. **BC1/BC3 decode is written but never exercised** — no upstream sample uses
   compressed textures, and the capture has 576 BC images.
6. **`gltfscenerendering` (1.70%) and `multithreading` (0.22%) have no
   diagnosis.**
7. `nir_op_fexp2`, `flog2` and lowered `fpow` still use the NVVM `.approx`
   intrinsics. Routing pow to the CUDA library version was tried and changed the
   image without moving it closer to the reference, so it was reverted. `fsin`
   and `fcos` do *not* — see below.

## Lessons that cost the most to learn

**An unimplemented operation that returns zero destroys everything downstream.**
`textureSize` reading as zero made a blur kernel compute `1/0` for its tap
offsets and sample at infinity, blackening a whole frame; `terminate_if`
returning undef collapsed shaders; `gl_InstanceIndex` silently did nothing for a
while. `CUDAPIPE_DEBUG_SHADER=1` lists them. Treat a zero from a missing feature
as a fault, not a default.

**A CUDA fault is sticky and surfaces at the wrong place.** An `imageLoad` one
texel outside its image killed a whole frame: the context faulted, the next
`cuMemAlloc` failed, and draws then bailed out for want of a visibility buffer
several stages away from the cause. `compute-sanitizer` turns this back into a
kernel name and a line.

**Read the other Mesa backends before deriving an algorithm.** llvmpipe is in
the same tree. `lp_bld_sample.c` had a better answer for anisotropic filtering
than two hand-derived attempts, including the degenerate-case guards that are
the hard part: `lp_apply_ellipse_transform` rewrites the derivative pair into
the ellipse's own axes in closed form, and `lp_build_rho_aniso` divides the
level of detail by the unrounded clamped ratio rather than the rounded tap
count.

**Bisect in the application's shader rather than estimating error magnitudes.**
`instancing` was 8.56% because NIR lowered sin/cos to a cheap polynomial
(`.lower_sincos`). The error is harmless when a shader rotates a *direction* and
not when it rotates a *position*: those asteroids orbit at radius 7 with
vertices spanning 0.06, an 80x lever. Static reasoning dismissed it twice — an
approximation good to 1e-6 was "far too small to matter" and the real error was
nearer 1e-3. Editing the shader to identity rotations, then restoring each in
turn, then swapping the hardware sin/cos for a Taylor polynomial, settled it in
minutes. `fsin`/`fcos` now call the CUDA library versions, carried by the
sampler module which is already NVRTC-compiled and linked on demand.

**Symmetric statistics hide per-object errors.** The same sample's rocks were
declared un-displaced because the best *global* shift over a crop was (0.00,
0.00) — a measure dominated by the unmoved majority. Per-object centroids showed
a median of 0.76 px and a tail to 9. Measure the thing that is claimed to be
wrong, not an aggregate over it.

**A guard has to sit at every site, not the shared helper.** The alpha-test
reject check was added to `rasterize_pixel` and changed nothing, because all
three rasterizer stages have their own inlined pixel loops; there are four
`atomicMin` sites and only one went through the helper. Identical covered *and*
discarded counts on every pass was the symptom.

**Procedural hashes are a poor oracle.** `starfield.frag` builds stars from a
hash that multiplies by ~440 and takes `fract`, so any last-bit difference in an
interpolated varying relocates a star. Two correct implementations disagree
there; about a quarter of `instancing`'s remaining pixels are this. The same
applies to a checkerboard test texture, where aliasing makes correct renderers
disagree enormously — the offscreen bench uses a smooth gradient on purpose.

**Record negative results.** Precise `pow` and forcing base-level LOD were both
tried, measured, and reverted; without the note in the commit they would be
retried.

## Implementation notes

* `.cu` kernels are stringified at build time by `kernels/cu_to_inc.py`.
* `struct cp_resource` embeds `struct llvmpipe_resource` first — lavapipe reads
  its fields at fixed offsets. Don't reorder.
* The visibility buffer stores the triangle index complemented (`~triID`) so
  `atomicMin` resolves coplanar triangles in primitive order.
* `pipe_screen::allocate_memory` returns `cuMemAllocManaged` memory with
  `cuCtxSetCurrent` first, because lavapipe allocates from its submit thread. A
  context may be current on several threads at once.
* **Every level of a resource sits at its own `mip_offsets[level]`.** Leaving it
  out of an address does not merely lose the small levels: `cp_resource_copy_region`
  omitted it, so a mip chain built by copying into successive levels had level 0
  written over and over and the rest untouched. That stayed invisible until
  `textureLod` started being honoured. The same class of bug is why uploads of
  level 1 once landed on level 0.
* NIR keeps a storage image's format on the intrinsic and hands the shader
  whatever type it asked for, so the driver owns both the texel stride and the
  packing. Taking the stride from the destination type walks the image at the
  wrong rate.
* Vertex attributes with fewer than four components read as `(0, 0, 0, 1)`. A
  shader taking a vec3 position as vec4 otherwise loses its transform's
  translation column — the geometry still draws and still writes depth, so it
  looks like a missing object rather than a broken one.
* A draw with no vertex buffer is legitimate: a vertex shader may build its
  positions from `gl_VertexIndex` alone, which is how a fullscreen pass is
  drawn. `load_vertex_id` reads the id array rather than recomputing it, so
  shaders carry `reads_vertex_id` and the array is materialised only for those.
* `bind_rasterizer_state` carries the cull mode. Drawing what should have been
  culled is not just wasted work — a back face can win the depth test and hide
  the surface in front of it.
* LLVM's NVPTX backend only knows architectures that existed when it was
  released, so `CP_MAX_PTX_SM` in `cp_nir_to_llvm.c` caps the architecture and
  lets the driver JIT forward. Raise it together with the PTX ISA version.
