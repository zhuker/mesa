# cudapipe as a native Vulkan driver

The same CUDA rasterizer backend with Mesa's common Vulkan runtime in front of
it, instead of lavapipe and Gallium.

**Branch `cudapipe-vk-native`. Status: milestone 1 of 6 — a physical device is
enumerated. Nothing renders yet.**

## Why, and — first — why not

**Not for the reasons that sound best.** Two capabilities were named as the
motivation and both were measured on the two captures before any code was
written. Both price at zero:

- **Pass-wide draw reordering.** With the whole render pass visible, opaque
  draws could be regrouped by shader, since opaque visibility resolves by
  `atomicMin` and is order-free. Measured with `CUDAPIPE_DEBUG_PASSSEQ` over
  both replays: opaque geometry groups today (consecutive equal `(vs, fs)`)
  versus if freely reordered (distinct `(vs, fs)`) are **6,027 vs 6,027** on
  Crossroads and **32,387 vs 32,387** on the old capture. Exactly equal, in
  every pass, including the worst one in the tree (136 opaque draws → 34 runs →
  34 distinct shader pairs). The applications already submit opaque geometry
  sorted by material. Reordering buys nothing.
- **Immutable samplers known at pipeline-compile time.** Instrumented
  `lvp_CreateDescriptorSetLayout`: of 382 sampler bindings on Crossroads and
  1,088 on the old capture, **zero** are immutable and none is an array. The
  sampler state lives in descriptor writes at run time, which is exactly where
  the existing provenance capture already finds it — and that specialization
  measured 34.47 vs 34.63 ms, about 0.5%, with every broader variant
  regressing.

**And not for host CPU time.** EPISODES measured lavapipe and gfxrecon together
at under 2% of host time. That number wants re-taking now the frame is three to
five times smaller, but it will not become a headline.

**The reason is that a large part of this driver exists only to reconstruct
what Vulkan states and Gallium discards**, and that reconstruction is where the
subtlest correctness constraints live:

| machinery | what it rebuilds | lines |
|---|---|---|
| draw batching + its flush discipline | that a draw is a complete, immutable record | ~550 in `cp_context.c`, 25 `cp_batch_flush` call sites |
| pass episodes + segment snapshots | that a run of draws can be examined together | ~1,350, plus ~50 KB × `CP_PASS_MAX_SEGS` (64) ≈ 3 MB of context state |
| `cp_pass_live_save/restore` | that a draw's bindings are its own | inside the above |
| `cp_pass_fallback` | a second execution path over that snapshot | inside the above |
| small-allocation arena + managed allocation cache | that descriptor sets need not each own a device allocation | ~270 here, more in `cp_resource.c` |

Roughly 2,000 lines of `cp_context.c`'s 9,034, and three of this driver's most
expensive bugs came from that seam: `vulkanscene` 12.9% wrong with batches of
size *one*; a held-back draw launching with the next draw's fragment bindings,
57% of the image wrong; and the clip-convention mismatch (Vulkan `0 ≤ z ≤ w`
against Gallium `−w ≤ z ≤ w`) that blacked out Crossroads frames 633 and 756.

Two further things the layer costs that no hook recovers cheaply: render-pass
load/store ops, which a tile renderer wants, and per-command-buffer parallel
translation — the driver is single threaded on the host and lavapipe's
record-then-replay-on-submit model is why.

So the case is **simplification and host parallelism**, not unlocked
optimisation. Anyone extending this document should keep that distinction; it
is the one the tiling prototype lost.

## Shape

`src/cudapipe/` — a Vulkan driver on `src/vulkan/runtime`, the nvk/radv/turnip
shape. Kept:

- `spirv_to_nir` and the whole NIR→PTX backend, unchanged;
- the kernels, rasterizer, A-buffer, episodes-as-an-algorithm (the *grouping*
  survives; the *deferral* does not);
- `vk_meta` for blit, resolve, clear, copy and fill on top of our own draws;
- `vk_render_pass`, `vk_graphics_state`, `vk_descriptors`, `vk_sync`.

Dropped: `pipe_context` and everything written to satisfy it.

Not needed at all: WSI. This driver is headless, which removes the single
largest chunk of ordinary Vulkan bring-up.

## Staging, and the gate at each step

The rule this project already proved twice — verify a refactor is bit-identical
before layering behaviour on it — is the whole plan:

1. **Factor, no behaviour change.** Split `cp_context.c` into a backend core
   with a Vulkan-shaped internal API and a thin Gallium adapter over it.
   *Gate: 18-sample sweep byte-identical, capture at exactly 0.441% / 0.002%.*
2. **Milestone 1 — enumerate.** ✅ done. `src/cudapipe` builds a second ICD;
   `tests/cpvk_smoke.c` reports the RTX 5090 as a Vulkan physical device with
   the three memory types session 13 had to negotiate with lavapipe.
3. **Milestone 2 — device, queue, memory, buffers, images.**
4. **Milestone 3 — pipelines and descriptors**, feeding the existing NIR→PTX
   compiler.
5. **Milestone 4 — command buffers**: record, then translate a whole render
   pass at submit. This is where batching and episodes stop existing.
6. **Milestone 5 — parity.** triangle → the 18 samples → both captures,
   **diffed against the Gallium-hosted build, not against NVIDIA.** Both
   targets are built from one tree precisely so this comparison exists.
7. **Milestone 6 — spend the new information**: pass-scoped binning for the
   tiler, load/store elision, parallel command translation. One measured change
   at a time.

llvmpipe is untouched throughout and stays the calibration reference. The two
ICDs coexist, so any frame can be rendered both ways.

## Milestone 1, as built

    cpvk_private.h       instance / physical device / device objects
    cpvk_device.c        instance, enumeration, properties, memory, queues
    cpvk_target.c        vk_icdGetInstanceProcAddr

```

Known gaps at this milestone, recorded rather than discovered later:

- `vulkaninfo --summary` still segfaults on an entrypoint the driver returns
  NULL for; the smoke test is the milestone, not vulkaninfo. Finding that
  entrypoint is the first task of milestone 2.
- `cpvk_GetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties2` deliberately reports nothing. A
  capability advertised and then clamped is worse than one refused — the
  multisampling sample already demonstrated that here.
- Limits are the capture's requirements, not the backend's measured maxima.
  They should be raised as features land, not ahead of them.
